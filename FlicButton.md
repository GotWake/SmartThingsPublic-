## Flic button

Device handler that tries to simulate an hardware flic button. Here's what it can do:

- Click, doubleClick and hold event
- For each click, doubleClick and hold event, record the last time the action was perforrmed
- Choose between black, white, turquise, green and yellow color
- Support multiple buttons of the same color to differenciate them
 
 This device handler works really well with the expose-rest api app. https://github.com/jbisson/SmartThingsPublic/blob/master/ExposeRestApi.md
 Combined the two together, it allows you to receive click, doubleClick and hold events from a real flic button (hardware).  
 
 Once the event is inside the smartthing, you could use CoRE (Communityâ€™s own Rule Engine) for defining your own rule. (ie: When I click on my flicButton do this, ect)

 The mapping between action and button numbers are as follow, this will be very usefl if using CoRE smartApps:  
     Click event:         Button#1 -> pushed  
     Double Click event:  Button#2 -> pushed  
     Hold event           Button#3 -> pushed
